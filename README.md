# Bahrian Novotny My Universe
Hi, I’m Bahrian Novotny — a 15-year-old high school student with a deep fascination for science, technology, and the endless possibilities they open up.
From exploring the mechanics of the universe to experimenting with creative coding and engineering, I’m constantly looking for new ways to learn, build, and share ideas.
This website grew out of that passion. For over a year, I had planned to build a portfolio site — but I wanted something different. Something exciting. Something interactive.
Welcome to my universe.

# Project Mariner: How This Site Was Born

It all began with a simple HTML prototype. Instead of the ship you see now, there was a pyramid you could steer in the most basic way using a joystick, along with some very early camera rotation controls.
About a week later, I had refined both the design and the functionality. I realized that by limiting the controls, the site would feel more polished — so I made the camera snap back to a fixed position and only allowed permanent zoom adjustments.
Around that time, I replaced the pyramid with the USS Enterprise-D and introduced a loading screen.
Next came the planets. The tricky part was making sure they stayed as far apart from each other as possible. Finally, I implemented a feature where, when the ship enters a planet’s inner sphere to analyze it, the planet stops moving — and as soon as the ship leaves, it accelerates to catch up to the position it would have reached had it never stopped.
