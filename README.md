# Bahrian Novotny My Universe — Beta Edition

Welcome to the **Beta Edition** of *My Universe* — a living, experimental space where new features are designed, tested, and refined before they make it to the main site.

This Beta is open to everyone — developers, designers, testers, or anyone with an idea to contribute. I am happy for your ideas and code improvement, that I will try to implement as soon as possible.

From experimental navigation systems to new planet interactions, enhanced animations, and prototype content modules — this is the playground where the future of *My Universe* is forged. It’s a place to break things, fix them, and make them better.

If you’re ready to explore, test, and help build the next chapter of *My Universe*, then welcome aboard.
This isn’t just my universe anymore — it’s ours.
